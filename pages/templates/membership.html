      <h3>Club Membership</h3>
      <p>
      As laid forth in the Clemson Running Club Constitution, all members must pay annual dues
      in order to maintain membership with the organization. This is required by Clemson University
      Student Organizations. For the 2019-2020 school year, the dues breakdown is as follows:</p>
      <p>
      $20 General Club Due - ALL members must pay the general due, which is good for the the entire year.
      The general due covers club clothing, access to monthly dinners and team social events, and club daily runs.
      Payment of these dues helps to fund clothing and food for special events.</p>
      <p>
      $60 Fall Racing Fee - In addition to the General Club Due, the Fall Racing Fee must be paid for members who
      wish to compete in club races in the Fall semester. The racing fee covers a racing singlet, as well as all registration,
      travel, lodging, and gas for any fall racing event. It does not cover food while on trips.</p>
      <p>
      $60 Spring Racing Fee - In addition to the General Club Due, the Spring Racing Fee must be
      paid for members who wish to compete in club races in the Spring semester. The racing fee covers a racing singlet,
      as well as all registration, travel, lodging, and gas for any fall racing event. It does not cover food while on trips.
      You may pay the spring racing fee in the spring regardless of your fall racing status, or may pay it in the fall in addition
      to the fall racing fee.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      Non-racing member: $20<br>
      Racing member, fall only: $80<br>
      Racing member, spring only: $80<br>
      <p>Racing member, entire year: $130</p><br>
      <p>While there is no hard deadline for dues payment, we ask that all members pay as promptly as possible
      once they know the club is something they are interested in being involved with. Members who want their T-Shirt size garunteed must submit club dues prior to October 1st. Members who wish to race
      must pay dues prior to their first away race. The first home race will be free of charge to any new members interested in racing. If you have any questions regarding dues, please reach out to our
      Treasurer, Paul Gennett, at run@g.clemson.edu or sgennet@g.clemson.edu.</p>
